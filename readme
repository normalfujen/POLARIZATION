This is a readme file for BPDF models at TOA
/BPDF : an excel file for surface BPDF models and observed POLDER data for each IGBP class
/IGBP_Data_for_16_Classes: The Geometry, NDVI, surface polarized reflectance for each BPDF or measured ata surface to compare and input into 6SV
/IGBP_Surface_reflectance: Surface reflectance dataset for IGBP01, 10, 12, 13, 16
sixs_2v_rayleigh_depolarization.pro: main IDL program for running sixs and read data from previous directories
pol_reflectance_transfer.pro: a subroutine used in previous IDL main program
sixsV2.1: 6SV 



#NOTE#
You could use the main IDL program to get IGBP01 data, and change corresponding code parts to change IGBP,AOD and other parameters.
You need to run this code in Unix with gfortran compiler
